## **Teaching Experience**

### **Instructor**

* ***Introductory Astronomy lab***  - *2018, 2017, 2013, 2012*

  Taught the course on practical astronomy lab to undergraduate students ( 27 in each class) for 4 semesters. The course objective was to understand astronomy concepts using computer softwares, workbooks, presentations and observations through telescopes and planetarium. Developed the curriculum, taught class weekly, guided them through nighttime telescope observations, and graded the course.

### **Telescope & Planetarium Operator** 

* ***Observational component of various courses*** - *2018*

  Guided undergraduate students through telescope observations and delivered planetarium lectures few nights every week.

### **Teaching Assistant**

* ***Astronomical Universe -***  *2017, 2012*
* **Life in the Universe** - *2013*

  Graded these undergraduate courses, and held regular office hours for students.

### **Guest Lecturer** 

* ***Stars and Galaxies -*** *2013*
* ***Stars, Galaxies, and the Universe -*** *2012*

## **Advising**


* Mentored two Masters Students for their semester long projects. Conceptualized the problems, gen-
erated the dataset for analysis by performing radiative transfer simulations and helped them with
running simulations and statistical analysis.
  * ***Origin of extended lyman alpha emission*** - Will Ceva (Masters student, UniGe) 2021

    Investigated the origin of extended Lyman alpha emission (Lya Halos) that is often observed in galax-
ies at early universe, especially around reionization by analyzing 50 simulated galaxies.
  * ***How lyman alpha emitters work*** - Jaime Roman Garza (Masters student, UniGe) 2020

    Researched the impact of the inter-stellar medium (ISM) structure (covering fraction, column density
etc) on the escape of the Lyman-alpha radiation from early galaxies.

* Mentored two groups of school students (3 each) during summer research programs (2023, 2024),
guiding them through projects on exoplanet habitability; introduced astronomy software and data
tools, and supported them in developing and presenting their findings.
